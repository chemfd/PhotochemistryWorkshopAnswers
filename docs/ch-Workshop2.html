<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"> <em>The quantum yield and lifetime of a dye were measured to be 0.43 &amp; 2.6 ns respectively. What is the natural lifetime?</em></p>
<p>The fluorescence quantum yield (equation <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a> and fluorescence lifetime (equation <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a>) are related to the rate constants for the different decay processes.</p>

\tau_f = \frac{1}{k_f^0+k_{ic}+ k_{ST}+k_{\textrm{other}}}

<p>The natural lifetime is the lifetime when the only decay pathway is fluorescence emission (equation <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:natural">(2.3)</a>).</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:natural">\[\begin{equation}
\tau_f^0 = \frac{1}{k_f^0}

<p>Combining equations <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a> and <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}

</div>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"> <em>Suggest why the fluorescence quantum yield in this system is so high.</em></p>
<p>The only things that affect the quantum yield and lifetime (equations <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a> and <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a>) are the different rate constants involved. The quantum yield is a measure of the proportion of excited states which decay by each pathway.</p>
<p>Therefore if the quantum yield of fluorescence is near unity then neither the rate of intersystem crossing or internal conversion is large. Intersystem crossing may occur due to the change in orbital type offered, but given the lack of heavy atoms this rate is unlikely to be high and will probably be a negligable proprortion given the high rates of other processes.</p>
<p>The rate of intersystem crossing is more efficient for rotations than vibrations (due to the closwer spacing of rotational energy levels), therefore if rotations can occur the rate of internal conversion tends to be quite high. In this case there is only one likely bond that could rotate to loose the excited state of the system. This is the single bond linking the two ring systems. Rotation around this bond is severly inhibited though due to the presence of the acid group which restricts rotation.</p>
<p>Please note that it is rotations around bonds that cross the conjugation within the molecule that allow for the most efficient energy loss.</p>

</div>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"> <em>Why are the absorption bands between 200 – 350 nm not reflected in the emission spectrum?</em></p>
<p>Kasha’s rule states <em>"An excited state always emits from the lowest energy level of that spin multiplicity state.</em> Consequently we can excite into any available orbital, but the excited state will rapidly decay into the lowest energy level of that multiplicity. So although we are exciting from S<sub>0</sub> into S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>… any excited state will rapidly decay by internal conversion down to the S<sub>1</sub> excited state and all emission will occur from this state.</p>
<p>Kasha’s rule is a consequence of the energy gap law which I alluded to when talking about the special case of azulene, but this will be covered in a video specifically talking about the energy gap law.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Conceptual question - Stokes’ shift</h2>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"> <em>The inorganic dye [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> has a measured lifetime in water of 580 ns and a natural lifetime of 13.8 µs.

</p>
</div>
<p>Firstly we need to separate two things - the first is just the origin of the Stokes’ shift due to the transition of an electron occuring very quickly leaving an optimised state to occupy an unoptimised state, which later relaxes. A typical Stokes’ shift is ~20 nm, the Stokes’ shift in this example is more than 150 nm… why?</p>
<p>If we consider the system that we have at hand, in this case [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> we can note the HOMO-LUMO transition is an MLCT. This has a large difference in structure of the HOMO &amp; LUMO with a redistribution of charge which will also have a large effect on the arrangement of the solvent shell. Given this large difference in optimised structure there would be a large shift.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>However this isn’t the only factor, the natural lifetime of 13.8 µs would indicate that the emission transition is phosphorescence, this spin forbidden transition has electrons alligned in parallel which is lower than the corresponding singlet state. So after excitation there is a change in multiplicity of the excited state, this lowers the energy of the system further moving the <span class="math inline">\(\lambda _{max}\)</span> of emission to lower energy (longer wavelength).</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"> <em>The asymmetric cyanine dye YO-Pro-1 is a DNA stain because it has a large increase on fluorescence emission when binding to DNA. The lifetime in free solution is around 2 ps and when bound to DNA is 2.4 ns. What is the structural origin of the large increase of emission upon binding?</em></p>

<p>The chromophore YO-Pro-1 has a methine bridge between the two halves of the chromophore, this offers efficient loss of the excited state <em>via</em> internal conversion (see question <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#sec:structure">2.3</a>. As noted earlier free rotation around a bond which cuts across the conjugation is particularly efficient in deactivating an excited state.</p>
<p>If this pathway is inhibited by binding to the DNA (the dye intercalates between the base pairs but any dye DNA interaction would inhibit this mechanism of excited state decay) then the fluorescence lifetime will increase (equation <a href="ch-Workshop2.html#eq:lifetimefluor">(2.2)</a>).</p>

<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>- What is the origin of the large Stoke’s shift (λ~max ex~ = 520 nm, λ~max em~ = 608 nm)</em></p>
<p>We are told the transition is fluorescence, but it has a very long natural lifetime. This long lifetime would indicate that despite the transition being selection rule allowed there is a structural explanation for the inefficiency of this process.</p>
<p>This would indicate that there is now a poor overlap integral indcating a poor overlap of the excited state and ground state structures, or there is a large difference in the structures of the excited and ground states.</p>
<p>This large difference in structure would be accounted for in the Stokes’ shift - a large deviation in structure would lead to a larger energy loss upon the optimisation of the excited state.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>- What transitions are responsible for the absorption features in the:</em>
<span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>400-600 nm range
<span style="color: darkcyan;"></em>200-350 nm range</p>
<p>The molecule has hetero atoms and so there will be both <span class="math inline">\(n-\pi*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi-\pi*\)</span> transitions, the <span class="math inline">\(n-\pi*\)</span> transitions will occur at lower energy (higher wavelength) and be the HOMO-LUMO transition.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>- Why are the features in the 200-350 nm range not replicated in the emission spectrum?</em></p>
<p>Kasha’s rule states <em>"An excited state always emits from the lowest energy level of that spin multiplicity state.</em> Consequently we can excite into any available orbital, but the excited state will rapidly decay into the lowest energy level of that multiplicity. So although we are exciting from S<sub>0</sub> into S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3</sub>… any excited state will rapidly decay by internal conversion down to the S<sub>1</sub> excited state and all emission will occur from this state.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>- Why does deuterating the solvent (or DNA) effect the lifetime of the excited state?</em></p>
<p>Ultimately because it affects the rates of internal conversion, and so the lifetime is changed as described in equation @(eq:lifetimefluor). We will learn more as to why when we cover the energy gap law.</p>

<p>You would expect the emission lifetime and quantum yield to increase on freezing (as described in equation @(eq:lifetimefluor)) as the efficiency (and therefore rate) of internal conversion mechanisms (particularly rotational relaxation) would be dramatically reduced in solid systems.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>A study of the thermodynamics of the dye DNA system measured the binding constant of EB with DNA to be 1.05 × 10<sup>6</sup>.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>- Why is the measured quantum yield for a system containing 2 µM EB and 20 mM DNA only 0.18?</em></p>
<p>This will be due to there being two states - one where the chromophore is bound, one where it is not. It is an equilibrium so not all dye will be bound to DNA. When not bound there is no fluorescence enhancement. The quantum yield we see is in fact a weighted average between the two states.</p>
<p>This is a problem solving question and any reasonable attempt would have been given credit. It is demonstrating an ability to think about data and the problem in a scientific manner.</p>
<p><span style="color: darkcyan;"><em>- Why would increasing the ionic strength of the solution, increase the fluorescence intensity of EB in solution with DNA?</em></p>
<p>This would push the equilibrium to form the dye:DNA complex increasing binding, as the binding increases the proportion of molecules displaying the higher quantum yield increases and the overall emission intensity of the sample increases.</p>
