## Short conceptual question - Electronic-vibrational overlap integrals {#sec:overlap}

```{r echo=FALSE, overlap, out.width='30%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The grond and excited state potential wells and the vibrational levels within them.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/overlap.png")
```

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*On the figure sketch the vibrational energy levels in the ground and the excited state.*

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*How would the following affect this overlap integral?*

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*1. Energy gap.*

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*1. The vibrational energy gaps*

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*1. Reaction coordinate (the difference in structure between ground and excited state)*


```{r echo=FALSE, overlapans, out.width='100%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The vibrational wavefunctions of the HOMO and LUMO showing the overlap (visualised as the overlapping of the wavefunctions). This overlap integral depends upon (left) the energy gap of HOMO and LUMO, the reaction coordinate (second left) and the spacing of vibrational energy levels (right).'}

```

In each case the overlap integral between the HOMO and LUMO is different, and therefore the associated rate of internal conversion will be different.

Remember that the rate of internal conversion to the lowest vibrational level in any electronic excited state is high, and so we are looking at the overlap between the v' = 0 and v = n states.

## Short conceptual question - The effect of structural changes on quantum yield {#sec:structureQY}

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene and trans-stilbene (figure \@ref(fig:stilbeneindene)) are similar in structure but have very different fluorescent quantum yields of 1.00 and 0.05 respectively, however for trans-stilbene this increases to 0.75 at 77 K. Suggest a reason for the difference in quantum yield of:*
    
<span style="color: darkcyan;">*- the two molecules*
<span style="color: darkcyan;">*- the two temperatures*
    
```{r echo=FALSE, stilbeneindene, out.width='60%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-a]indene (left) and trans-stilbene (right)'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/stilbeneindene.png")
```    

If we consider the difference in quantum yield of the two chromophores then rotational pathways aren't available to the indine choromophore.

Considering this on a more mathematical level (but still with no maths), for the stilbene there is a large difference in the ground and excited state structures (because the excited state reduces the bond order of the highest energy bond (the non aromatic π bond) giving these atoms sp3 character).

This would indicate that the two potential wells are offset by a larger amount leading to a good overlap integral between the HOMO and LUMO states which is not available when the difference in reaction coordinate is smaller.

However the structure of the indine in ground and excited state is similar and so the overlap integrals will be much smaller.

When considering the effect of temperature on the quantum yield of stilbene, at first you may consider this to not have an effect (as there is no temperature term in the energy gap law), however, there is now no longer free rotation allowed and so the closely spaced rotational levles (which allow very efficient excited state deactivation) are no longer the principle deactivation pathway.

## Short mathematical question - Effect of the rate of singlet triplet intersystem crossing on th quantum yield of phosphorescence {#sec:ratephos}

<span style="color: darkcyan;">*Why is it likely that the quantum yield of phosphorescence of a sample would increase after the sample is frozen.*

The quantum yield of phosphorescence ($\phi_p$)depends upon the quantum yield of singlet to triplet intersystem crossing ($\phi_{ST}$), as described in equation \@ref(eq:QYphos).

\begin{equation}
\phi_p = \phi_{ST}\frac{k_p^0}{k_p^0+ k_{TS}+k_{\textrm{other}}}
(\#eq:QYphos)
\end{equation}

with the quantum yield of singlet to triplet intersystem crossing ($\phi_{ST}$) given by equation \@ref(eq:QYST)

\begin{equation}
\phi_{ST} = \frac{k_{ST}}{k_f^0+k_{ic}+ k_{ST}+k_{\textrm{other}}}
(\#eq:QYST)
\end{equation}

So as with Question \@ref(sec:structureQY) we have the reduction of reate of internal conversion ($k_{IC}$) falls when the sample is frozen as the rotational deactivation pathways are no longer available. If $k_{IC}$ is smaller (and other rates don't change), then the quantum yield of singlet to triplet intersystem crossing ($\phi_{ST}$) increases.

## Short mathematical question - Determining the quantum yield of phosphorescence {#sec:calcphos}

A molecule decays by a combination of internal conversion, intersystem crossing and phosphorescence. What is the quantum yield of phosphorescence?

- k~IC~ = 2.1 × 10^11^ s^−1^
- k~ST~ = 2.9 × 10^9^ s^−1^
- k~TS~ = 7.4 × 10^6^ s^−1^
- k~p~^o^ = 6.2 × 10^8^ s^−1^

## Short conceptual question - Deactivation of excited state aromatic hydrocarbsons {#sec:exhydrocarbons}

Table: (\#tab:smallmolQY) The quantum yields of various deactivation processes in small organic molecules measured at 77 K in a glass matrix.

| | Φ~f~ | Φ~ST~ |  ΔE /  kJ mol^−1^|
|:--------------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Napthalene | 0.20 | 0.80 | 385 |
| Anthracene | 0.70 | 0.30  | 318 |
| Pyrene | 0.6 | low | 322 |
| Tetracene | 0.1 | 0.65  | 251 |
| Pentacene | 0.10 | 0.15 | 209 |

When examining the data above suggest why it is likely why the quantum yields of both fluorescence and singlet to triplet intersystem crossing decrease with increasing molecule size.

## Short conceptual question - Affect of deuteration of solvents. {#sec:dsolvent}

Singlet oxygen has a phosphorescence wavelength of around 1070 nm and a lifetime of 2 µs in water, how would you expect this lifetime to change for singlet oxygen in D~2~O?

## Short conceptual question - Isotope effects on deactivation of an excited state {#sec:isotope}

The fluorescence quantum yield and singlet state lifetime of both proteated and deuterated pyrene  are 0.90 and 450 ns respectively. Why does deuteration of the sample have no measureable affect on these values?

Conversely for naphthalene phosphorescence (in glass at 77 K) the quantum yield of phosphoresce increases from 0.05 to ~0.80 on deuteration of the sample. (ΔE = 251  kJ mol^−1^ ). Explain this observation with respect to the energy gap law.

## Short conceptual question - The effect of heavy attoms on the rate of intersystem crossing {#sec:heavy}

Table: (\#tab:heavyatom) The affect of substitution of different halogens on the rates of phosphorescence and singlet to triplet intersystem crossing.

| | k~p~ | k~ST~ |  Φ~p~ / Φ ~f~ |
|:--------------|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| Napthalene | 0.05 | 0.39 | 0.09 |
| 1-fluoronaphthalene | 0.23 | 0.42 | 0.07 |
| 1-chloronaphthalene | 1.1 | 2.35 | 5.2 |
| 1-bromonaphthalene | 13.5 | 36.5 | 169 |
| 1-iodonaphthalene | 190 | 310 | >760 |

Briefly explain why the rates of these processes increase as we move down the group.

## Short conceptual question - The effect of absorbance and emission wavelengths on the quantum yield of emission {#sec:osphen}

Table: (\#tab:osphen) The spectroscopic details of a family of osmium complexes.

| | λ~abs~ / nm | λ~em~ / nm | ΔE / eV | τ/ ns | Φ~em~ |
|:----------------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| [Os(phen)~3~]^2+^ | 650 | 720 | 0.186 | 260 | 0.016 |
| [Os(phen)~2~(dppene)]^2+^ | 455 | 609 | 0.69 | 1830 | 0.138 |
| [Os(phen)(dppene)~2~]^2+^ | 400 | 530 | 0.761 | 3600 | 0.518 |

Why does the fluorescence lifetime increase as the phenanthroline ligands are replaced with dppene ligands?
