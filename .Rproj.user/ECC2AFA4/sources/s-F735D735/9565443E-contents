# Welcome {-}

The notes have been prepared in a package called BookDown for RStudio so that the equations are accessible to screen readers. However, by providing the notes as a .html webpage I can also embed short videos to further describe some of the topics. Further you can download the questions (and later the answers, top left of the screen) in a format that suits you (either pdf or epub) to view offline, or change the way this document appears for ease of reading.

## Workshops for Photochemistry & Photophysics {-}

The course will use a question first approach and we will learn the material by answering the questions. The questions will are shared here in an accessible format, and this page will be updated weekly.

This is the answers for workshop questions, the answers have been prepared from collaborative problem solving from the CH30129 class of 2020-21.
